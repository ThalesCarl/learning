    "# The `super` builtin function\n",
    "\n",
    "The builtin function `super` is used when we want to call a method from a base class from the derived class. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LastUpdatedOrderedDict(OrderedDict):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Stores items keeping the update order\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n",
    "        super().__setitem__(key, value)\n",
    "        self.move_to_end(key)\n",
    "\n",
    "# We could do the above like this\n",
    "class NotRecommended(OrderedDict):\n",
    "    \"\"\"A counter example\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n",
    "        OrderedDict.__setitem__(self, key, value)\n",
    "        self.move_to_end(key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterexample above works for this particular case, but it's not recommended because we need to repeat the base class name. Calling `super()` is used because it supports multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of the `super()` function is in constructors, where we use it to call the `__init__()` function from the base class in the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, a, b):\n",
    "        super().__init__(a, b) # instantiate base class attributes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` has two arguments that are inferred by the interpreter in most cases, but we might need to use them in special cases, such as, bypassing the method resolution order (MRO), for testes, and so on. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `type`: The name of the superclass, or the beginning of the path to the desired method\n",
    "- `object_or_type`: The object that will be called (for instance methods)  or the class (for class methods). By default, it is `self` when the call is from within a instance method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subclasses of builtin types (danger)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since python 2.2, we can have a subclass of a builtin type, like a `dict`, a `str` or a `list`. However, the CPython will not normally call the overloaded methods of the builtin types, as seen below. This could lead to various unknown behaviors. This is because the builtin types calls direct the C interface below instead of a class defined in python. The solution to this problem is to inherit from `UserDict`, `UserStr` and `UserList`, available at `collections` lib, instead of the builtin type."

    "\n",
    "There's no consensus about the best way to use inheritance, specially multiple inheritance. But, here are some good practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prefer composition instead of inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible, do not extend the inheritance chain, but if makes sense, use a object inside another to have the functionality necessary, instead of just inherit the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understand the reason of using inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Use inheritance only if you have a clear reason to do so. For example:\n",
    "- Inheritance of interfaces which creates a subtype. Preferably, only inherit from ABCs.\n",
    "- Inheritance used to avoid duplication of code (can be replaced by composition). Usage of mixins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make the interface explicit using ABCS\n",
    "\n",
    "If your class is an interface, it should be explicitly be a ABC or a subclass of `typing.Protocol`. A ABC should be subclass of `abc.ABC` or other ABCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use mixins explicitly in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixin should be projected to allow new functionalities to another classes. However, it cannot be used to instantiate a concrete object and should not be used as only base class to another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use, whenever possible, the suffix `Mixin` to name the mixin class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Offer aggregated classes to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "A aggregated class is a class that has no/almost none functionality on its own, but inheriting from mixins and ABCs can provide a wrapper to those classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Only inherit of classes that were designed to be inherited\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating subclasses and overloading methods of complex classes is a error prone process. So, prefer to inherit from classes that have on its documentation that it should be used as a base class. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are projecting a class that should be used a base class, put in the documentation which methods could/must be overloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python 3.8, we have a `final` type that could be used to specify that the class should not be inherited from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid creating subclasses of concrete classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of concrete objects normally have a internal state that could be corrupted when we overload a function that depends on that state. Even if we use `super()` or the instance attributes use the protected `__x` syntax.\n",
