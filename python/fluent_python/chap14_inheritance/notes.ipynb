    "# The `super` builtin function\n",
    "\n",
    "The builtin function `super` is used when we want to call a method from a base class from the derived class. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LastUpdatedOrderedDict(OrderedDict):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Stores items keeping the update order\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n",
    "        super().__setitem__(key, value)\n",
    "        self.move_to_end(key)\n",
    "\n",
    "# We could do the above like this\n",
    "class NotRecommended(OrderedDict):\n",
    "    \"\"\"A counter example\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n",
    "        OrderedDict.__setitem__(self, key, value)\n",
    "        self.move_to_end(key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterexample above works for this particular case, but it's not recommended because we need to repeat the base class name. Calling `super()` is used because it supports multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of the `super()` function is in constructors, where we use it to call the `__init__()` function from the base class in the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, a, b):\n",
    "        super().__init__(a, b) # instantiate base class attributes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` has two arguments that are inferred by the interpreter in most cases, but we might need to use them in special cases, such as, bypassing the method resolution order (MRO), for testes, and so on. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `type`: The name of the superclass, or the beginning of the path to the desired method\n",
    "- `object_or_type`: The object that will be called (for instance methods)  or the class (for class methods). By default, it is `self` when the call is from within a instance method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subclasses of builtin types (danger)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since python 2.2, we can have a subclass of a builtin type, like a `dict`, a `str` or a `list`. However, the CPython will not normally call the overloaded methods of the builtin types, as seen below. This could lead to various unknown behaviors. This is because the builtin types calls direct the C interface below instead of a class defined in python. The solution to this problem is to inherit from `UserDict`, `UserStr` and `UserList`, available at `collections` lib, instead of the builtin type."
